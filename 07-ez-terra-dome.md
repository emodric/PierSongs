# The eZ Terra Dome

**Modified song lyrics for eZ Community by:** kracker

**Music style:** Agressive Solo Rap Battle (What in the industry is often called, status updates)

**Directions:** Sing to the tune of the song "Terra Dome" on the album "mansbestfriend vol.5" by Sole. Best to sing loud over a slightly slowed down mix of the original music with the original vocals trimmed down or just sing louder than the music like kracker ;)

**Singers:** Perform This ;) Aggressively like kracker would OR just rip off sole; whatever; like I care; no one really understands what the lyrics mean ...

**Special thanks:** Special thanks to the original artist; who would never see me or sanction this abuse of his beautiful work. Special thanks to the entire eZ Ecosystem which inspired me to draft this document in responce to something that inspired me to write this weeks before the twitter request for song PRs.

**Apologies:** To the original artist, "Tim, I got upset and days later thought it to be creative to try regardless; I'm sorry. I was wrong; in every way ... but I won't take back what I meant". To Repo owner, "Your tweet inspired me to share what I had already been working on privately. Again I'm sorry for trying. I knew they wouldn't understand it's meaning enough to accept it as uniquely relevant performance piece remixed". *This song is a parody**.

**Options:** These lyrics come with solo or group conditionals built in and optional singer / crowd embellishments

* Singular / Plural usage is provided; Watch for the / character; He's a tricky one ;) Also these options are consistent with the remix author's meanings; but not much else.

* Singer / Crowd embellishments usage is provided; These can be yelled by the singer and or the crowd at the same time for added effect, watch for *lyric text* (Crowd, Yells) syntax.


## Lyrics

(Music intro)

### Verse 1

*State very quickly in a whisper: "This was written as an eZ Publish forum post reply..."*.

(Pause)


Take your best shot ...

I / We ain't gonna leave, The Game ...

.. till I'm / We're old and grey and there ain't no customers left waitin' in the eze

and there ain't no long term plannin' ... *in my community* (Crowd, Yells)!

I think I'm / We're gonna have to skill someone ...

I haven't decided, who will be first / next ...

It's not that I'm / We're bitter or militant ...

I'm / We're only violent in my / our dreams ...

...so stay out my / our psyche and you'll be safe


You'll be rich in about 6 months ... *When Platform Ships* (Crowd, Yells)

You don't need to work, just vote for the right puppet .. *On the board* (Crowd, Yells)

.. and click the right box in feedback surveys to the company *eZ | Weyland-Utani* (Crowd, Yells)


Some people think it's ugly to talk ship online I'm one of those who agrees ...

So keep your back biting, ezpublish / legacy is dead; commentary to yourself!

Or I'll / We'll ruin it all myself, like kracker ruined v2 / it in 2002

and he ruined his own name before he had one ... and a name ain't nothing but a word

Like a Title, Like a Lord .. *so call us out* (Crowd, Yells)! Meet you at the flag pole ...

Censor us an I'll / We'll put your head on a stake, as a simple warning!




### Chorus

The real world is an implant and I'm tryin' to stay / use 'stable'.

They don't share much of nothin' and we still expect ship to spring from nothing. Ain't it something ...

The real world is an implant and I'm tryin' stay / use 'stable'.

They don't share much of nothin' and we still expect ship to spring from nothing. Ain't it something ...

### End Chorus


### Verse 2

Simple impulses ... man your a greedy beast! ... cutting up your own face ...

And you think your the only one cryin' ... and your barely getting even ... *kracker* (Crowd, Yells)

With the norse gods, for when they smited us / you, for making too much noise *in the forums* (Crowd, Yells). Bad consumer.

When men wrote the code, and rich men re-wrote it and poor men tried to fix / maintain it.


Peace to Martin Luther, Mr. Right and the cockroaches climbin' jacob's ladder;

Ain't no pot of gold waitin' ... *Let's do / get it anyway*! (Crowd, Yells)

In the here and now, I'm on my grind, up on my money, it's the only thing keeping me, from being a refuge, in my own home.

The one room apt I rent, from a would be tyrant.

It's 2015, only two / four years left.

The future ain't fixed, like an election, fools say I'm / We're negative electron.


But the world is dumb like flock of birds hitting a windmill farm; The future is upon us and I / We ain't scared it's claws are on us ...

The internet is only 9,000 days old, I'm about 13,000 a mile up and I / We ain't runnin' ...

Nothing but my / our mouth, in the water in my / our garden ...

And we see what's commin'? We prolly should be runnin', unplug me ...

But I / We can't run from this augmented reality, and why would I / We? *Go Neo*! (Crowd, Yells)



### Chorus

The real world is an implant and I'm tryin' to stay / use 'stable'.

They don't share much of nothin' and we still expect ship to spring from nothing. Ain't it something ...

The real world is an implant and I'm tryin' stay / use 'stable'.

They don't share much of nothin' and we still expect ship to spring from nothing. Ain't it something ...

### End Chorus
