# Google Chrome (to the tune of Pretty Woman by Roy Orbison)


Google Chrome  
You're a fast browser  
Google Chrome  
Got a good Inspector  
Google Chrome

I can't believe it  
It's not the truth  
How can Firefox be worse than you?  

Google Chrome, you're pretty fast  
You come from people who made the Glass  
Google Chrome, you're really good  
For me

Google Chrome, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Google Chrome is what I say  
Google Chrome, say you'll stay  
With me

'Cause I need you  
For development now  
Boot for me daily  
Please never crash  

Oh, oh, Google Chrome
