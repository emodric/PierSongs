## Lyrics

(Music intro)

### Chorus

It's always more fun

To share with everyone

It's always more fun

To share with everyone

### End Chorus

### Verse 1

If you have two

Give one to your friend

If you have three

Give one to your friend and me

### Chorus

It's always more fun

To share with everyone

It's always more fun

To share with everyone

### End Chorus

### Verse 2

If you've got one

Here is something you can learn

You can still share

Just by taking turns

### Verse 3

If you've got a ball

Bounce it to the gang

If there is a new kid

Invite him out to hang

If you've got one sandwich

Cut that thing in half

If you know a secret joke

Tell it and share a laugh

If you've got one drumsticks

Give one to your friend

Make one beautiful rhythm

Share a beat that never ends

And if you're feeling lonely

Share time with your mom

Share some milk and cookies

And sing the sharing song

### Chorus

It's always more fun

To share with everyone

It's always more fun

To share with everyone

It's always more fun

To share with everyone

### End Chorus

(Music outro)
